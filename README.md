BestPrice - DevOps Implementation on a Microservices Web App ðŸ›’

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing DevOps practices on a microservices-based web application. I transformed my previous monolithic web application into multiple microservices for better scalability and maintainability.

Each service has its own Dockerfile, and I used Kubernetes YAML configurations for deployment. The application is deployed using two different approaches:

âœ… Docker Compose â€“ for managing multi-container applications locally.

âœ… Minikube & Kubernetes â€“ for scalable deployment and orchestration.


ðŸ”§ DevOps Implementation

âœ… Microservices Architecture: Split the monolithic app into independent services.

âœ… Containerization: Created multiple Dockerfiles for different services.

âœ… Orchestration: Deployed services using Minikube and Docker Compose.

âœ… Automation: Configured YAML files for seamless deployment.
